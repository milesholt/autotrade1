Simple determination

if first three prices are below line, then we consider the trend to be bullish
if the opposite, then bearish
the assumption that after three confirmations within the range, this trend will continue
we're calling this the 'stair strategy' as this appears a number of times in charts
you'll have a upward/downward trend, then a range /fluctuation, then the trend will continue.
the strategy is to do a small buy/sell with a sharp stop and short limit, before the direction changes.

Another strategy - Range Bound trading

This strategy works within the range and the logic is to trade within support and resistance Lines
to mitigate risk

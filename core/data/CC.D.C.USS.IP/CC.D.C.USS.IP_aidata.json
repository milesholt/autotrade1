It is calculated by taking the average of closing prices over a specified period of time. The Moving Averages Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a technical analysis tool that is designed to identify the direction of a stock's trend. It is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average from the 12-day exponential moving average. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a technical analysis tool that is used to measure the strength of a stock's trend. It is calculated by dividing the average of the gains over a specified period of time by the average of the losses over the same period of time. The Fibonacci Retracement is a technical analysis tool that is used to identify potential support and resistance levels.Fibonacci Retracement lines connect important price points and can help predict where prices will go next. It is based on the idea that a stock's price will often retrace a certain percentage of its previous move. The Bollinger Bands is a technical analysis tool that is used to measure the volatility of a stock's price.

The RSI gives a score of 5 out of 10, indicating that the RSI is above 50, which suggests that the stock's price is overbought. The Fibonacci Retracement gives a score of 7 out of 10, indicating that the stock's price has retraced 61.8% of its previous move, which is a common Fibonacci retracement level. The Bollinger Bands gives a score of 6 out of 10, indicating that the stock's price is trading near the upper Bollinger Band, which suggests that the stock's price may be overbought.

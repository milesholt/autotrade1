The price action over the past few trading days has been volatile, with the stock price fluctuating within a wide range. Overall, the technical analysis is inconclusive, and further analysis and monitoring of the stock's performance is recommended.\n\nThe moving averages indicator shows that the stock price is below both the short-term and long-term moving averages, which suggests a potential downward trend. The MACD indicator is also bearish, with the MACD line below the signal line and the histogram bars below the zero line. This also suggests a potential downward trend.\n\nThe Fibonacci retracement indicator shows that the stock price is currently at the 61.8% retracement level, which is a potential support level. However, the stock price has been unable to hold above this level, which suggests that the downtrend may continue.\n\nThe RSI indicator is currently at 30, which is considered oversold territory.

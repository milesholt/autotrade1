The 50-day moving average is currently at $408.3, and the 200-day moving average is at $405.3. The relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 58.5, which indicates that the stock is overbought. The Bollinger Bands are currently widening, which indicates that volatility is increasing. Overall, the technical analysis suggests that the stock is likely to continue to trend upwards in the short term.\n\n**Moving Averages**\n\nThe moving averages are a technical analysis tool that helps to smooth out price data and identify trends. The 50-day moving average is a popular indicator that is used to identify short-term trends. The 200-day moving average is a popular indicator that is used to identify long-term trends. I give this analysis method a score of 7 out of 10, as it is a reliable indicator of both short and long-term trends.\n\n**MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**\n\nThe MACD is a technical analysis tool that is used to identify momentum. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. The MACD is then plotted with a signal line, which is a 9-day EMA of the MACD. I give this analysis method a score of 9 out of 10, as it is a reliable indicator of momentum.\n\n**Relative Strength Index (RSI)**\n\nThe RSI is a technical analysis tool that is used to measure momentum and identify overbought and oversold conditions. The RSI is calculated by dividing the average gain over the past 14 periods by the average loss over the past 14 periods. The RSI is then plotted on a scale of 0 to 100. I give this analysis method a score of 8 out of 10, as it is a reliable indicator of momentum and can help identify overbought and oversold conditions.\n\n**Fibonacci Retracement**\n\nThe Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool that is used to identify potential support and resistance levels. The Fibonacci retracement is based on the Fibonacci sequence, which is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The Fibonacci retracement levels are calculated by dividing the difference between the high and low prices of a given period by the Fibonacci ratios. I give this analysis method a score of 6 out of 10, as it is a less reliable indicator than the moving averages, MACD, and RSI.\n\n**Bollinger Bands**\n\nThe Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool that is used to identify volatility. The Bollinger Bands are calculated by adding and subtracting two standard deviations from the simple moving average (SMA) of a given period. The Bollinger Bands are then plotted on a chart with the SMA in the middle. I give this analysis method a score of 7 out of 10, as it is a reliable indicator of volatility.\n\n**Overall Trend**\n\nThe overall trend is upwards, as the stock has been making higher highs and higher lows since the 23rd July 2024. I give this a score of 8 out of 10, as the uptrend is clearly defined.\n\n**Risk Level**\n\nThe risk level is medium, as the stock is trading above its 50-day moving average but below its 200-day moving average. I give this a score of 3 out of 5, as the stock is in a consolidation phase and the risk of a pullback is moderate.\n\n**Overall Risk**\n\nThe overall risk is medium, as the stock is trading above its 50-day moving average but below its 200-day moving average. I give this a score of 3 out of 5, as the stock is in a consolidation phase and the risk of a pullback is moderate.\n\n**Decision**\n\nBased on the technical analysis, the stock is likely to continue to trend upwards in the short term. However, the stock is in a consolidation phase and the risk of a pullback is moderate. Therefore, I would recommend a **HOLD** position with a stop loss order below the 50-day moving average.","movingAverages":8,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":9,"relativeStrengthIndex":8,"fibonacciRetracement":6,"bollingerBands":7,"overallTrend":"upward","riskLevel":3,"overallRisk":"medium","decision":"HOLD","epic":"CC.D.C.USS.IP"}],"findings":{"movingAverages":3,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":4,"relativeStrengthIndex":3,"fibonacciRetracement":3,"bollingerBands":4,"overallTrend":"neutral","riskLevel":3,"overallRisk":"medium","decision":"HOLD","epic":"CC.D.C.USS.IP"},"open_position":false,"epic":"CC.D.C.USS.IP"}

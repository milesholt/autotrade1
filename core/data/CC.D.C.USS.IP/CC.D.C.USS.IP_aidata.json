The Bollinger Bands indicator suggests the stock is currently overbought.

The 50-day MA stayed below the 100-day MA. The volume of trades dropped significantly over the period, and there was a large increase in volume around the mid-point which was just before the stock price dropped below the 200-day MA. In addition, the RSI is below 50 which indicates a bearish or negative sentiment. Fibonacci retraction levels also show that the stock is potentially underpriced or undervalued (this is a bullish signal) but the Bollinger Bands indicate that the price could continue to fall, and the MACD is indicating a strong downward trend. Overall, the negative signals from the MACD, Bollinger Bands, and RSI outweigh the positive ones from the moving averages and Fibonacci Retracement. With a risk level of 2 and an overall risk of \"medium\", I would recommend to SELL since there is a higher probability that the price will continue to fall.","movingAverages":2,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":0,"relativeStrengthIndex":2,"fibonacciRetracement":7,"bollingerBands":2,"overallTrend":"downward","riskLevel":2,"overallRisk":"medium","decision":"SELL","epic":"CC.D.C.USS.IP"},{"summary":"The overall sentiment for this stock is slightly bullish but there are some signs of caution.

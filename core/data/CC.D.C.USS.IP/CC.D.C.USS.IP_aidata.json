The 10-day moving average is below the 50-day moving average, which is below the 200-day moving average. This suggests that the stock price is likely to continue to decline in the short term.\n\nMACD: The MACD indicator is also indicating a downward trend. The MACD line is below the signal line, and the histogram is below the zero line. This suggests that the selling pressure is stronger than the buying pressure, and that the stock price is likely to continue to decline in the short term.\n\nRelative Strength Index: The RSI is currently at 30. This indicates that the stock is oversold, and that a rebound may be due. However, the RSI is still below the 50 level, which suggests that the selling pressure is still strong.\n\nFibonacci Retracement: The Fibonacci retracement levels show that the stock price has retraced 50% of the distance from its previous low to its previous high. This suggests that the stock price may be due for a bounce, but it is not yet clear whether this bounce will be sustained.\n\nBollinger Bands: The Bollinger Bands are currently squeezed, which indicates that the stock price is not trending strongly in either direction. This suggests that the stock price may be due for a breakout in either direction soon.\n\nOverall, the technical analysis indicators are indicating a downward trend. However, the RSI is showing signs of being oversold, which suggests that a rebound may be due. The Bollinger Bands are also showing signs of a potential breakout, which could lead to a change in trend. Overall, the risk level is medium, and the overall risk is high. The decision is SELL.","movingAverages":2,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":2,"relativeStrengthIndex":6,"fibonacciRetracement":5,"bollingerBands":5,"overallTrend":"downward","riskLevel":3,"overallRisk":"high","decision":"SELL","epic":"CC.D.C.USS.IP"},{"summary":"The overall trend of the stock is upward.

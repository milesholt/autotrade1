The MACD is also below its signal line, which is another bearish sign.\n\n* **Fibonacci Retracement:** The Fibonacci retracement levels show that the stock price has recently retraced to the 61.8% level. This suggests that the stock price is likely to continue to retrace to the 50% level, which is a key support level.\n\n* **Bollinger Bands:** The stock price is currently below the lower Bollinger Band. This indicates that the stock price is oversold and is likely to bounce back in the short term.\n\n* **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The RSI is currently below 30, which indicates that the stock is oversold.

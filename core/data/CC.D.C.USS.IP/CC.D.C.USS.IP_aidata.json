This is due to a number of factors, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes. As a result, it is difficult to predict which way the market will go in the short term. However, over the long term, the stock market has always trended upwards. This is because companies tend to grow their earnings over time, which leads to higher stock prices. Therefore, investors who are looking to buy and hold stocks for the long term should not be discouraged by the current volatility. In the short term, however, it is important to be cautious and to manage your risk carefully.This is especially true for the EPIC stock which appears to be in a clear downtrend. The stock prices have a tendency to go down in the short term and whereas the rest of the market is trending upwards, this stock is continuing to fall. This would put the risk level to 3 out of 5 and the overall risk as high. Therefore it would be best to take the conservative approach and either hold or sell all shares in the stock.","movingAverages":0,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":0,"relativeStrengthIndex":0,"fibonacciRetracement":0,"bollingerBands":0,"overallTrend":"downward","riskLevel":3,"overallRisk":"high","decision":"HOLD","epic":"CC.D.C.USS.IP"}],"findings":{"movingAverages":5,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":4,"relativeStrengthIndex":5,"fibonacciRetracement":5,"bollingerBands":5,"overallTrend":["upward","neutral","upward","downward","downward"],"riskLevel":2,"overallRisk":"medium","decision":"HOLD","epic":"CC.D.C.USS.IP"},"open_position":false,"epic":"CC.D.C.USS.IP"}

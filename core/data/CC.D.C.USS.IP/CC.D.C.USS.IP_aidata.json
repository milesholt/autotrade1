The Relative Strength Index (RSI) method implies a neutral trend with a score of 5 out of 10, as the RSI values have oscillated around the 50 mark. The Fibonacci Retracement method suggests a potential for a moderate retracement with a score of 6 out of 10, as the price has reached the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. The Bollinger Bands method indicates a low level of volatility with a score of 7 out of 10, as the price has stayed within the Bollinger Bands for most of the period.

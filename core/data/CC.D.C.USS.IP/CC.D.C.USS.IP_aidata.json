There is a higher probability that the price will go down in the near term.\n\n**MACD**: The MACD line has crossed below the signal line, which is a bearish sign. This indicates that the stock may be due for a further decline.\n\n**Relative Strength Index**: The RSI is currently at 35. This indicates that the stock is slightly oversold, but not yet in oversold territory. This means that there is still some room for the stock to fall before it becomes oversold.\n\n**Fibonacci Retracement**: The Fibonacci retracement levels show that the stock has retraced to the 38.2% level. This is a common level for stocks to retrace to after a decline. If the stock continues to decline, it could reach the 50% or 61.8% retracement levels.\n\n**Bollinger Bands**: The Bollinger Bands are currently narrow, which indicates that the stock is not very volatile. This could mean that the stock is due for a breakout in either direction.\n\n\nOverall, the technical analysis suggests that the stock is likely to continue to decline in the near term. However, the stock is not yet oversold, so there is still some room for it to fall before it becomes a good buying opportunity.","movingAverages":3,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":5,"relativeStrengthIndex":6,"fibonacciRetracement":7,"bollingerBands":3,"overallTrend":"downward","riskLevel":4,"overallRisk":"high","decision":"SELL"},{"summary":"The technical analysis on CC.D.C.USS.IP resulted in a moving average score of 5 out of 10, a MACD score of 7 out of 10, a relative strength index score of 6 out of 10, a Fibonacci retracement score of 4 out of 10, and a Bollinger Bands score of 6 out of 10.

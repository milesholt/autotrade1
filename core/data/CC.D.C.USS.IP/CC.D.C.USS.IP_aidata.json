There was a slight uprise on the 29th of July, however, this was short lived and it has since continued to fall. Many of the technical indicators used for this analysis suggest that the overall trend is likely to continue and the stock price is predicted to fall in the long run. The Fibonacci Retracement and the Bollinger Bands indicators particularly highlight this downward trend. The RSI and the MACD indicators, however, give mixed signals and do not suggest a clear trend, with the RSI indicating an overbought position and the MACD showing signs of a potential reversal.\n\nOverall, the stock is considered to be a risky investment at the moment and caution is advised.

The most common moving averages are the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages. In this case, the moving averages are showing a positive slope, which indicates that the stock is in an uptrend.\n* MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): The MACD is a momentum indicator that shows the difference between the 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages. The MACD line is plotted above or below a signal line, which is the 9-day exponential moving average of the MACD line. In this case, the MACD line is above the signal line, which indicates that the stock is in a bullish trend.\n* RSI (Relative Strength Index): The RSI is a momentum indicator that shows the strength of a stock's price movement. The RSI is calculated by comparing the average gain of a stock over a specified period of time to the average loss of the stock over the same period of time. The RSI is plotted on a scale of 0 to 100, with a reading above 70 indicating that the stock is overbought and a reading below 30 indicating that the stock is oversold. In this case, the RSI is above 70, which indicates that the stock is overbought.\n* Fibonacci Retracement Levels: The Fibonacci retracement levels are a technical analysis tool that can be used to identify potential support and resistance levels. The Fibonacci retracement levels are based on the Fibonacci sequence, which is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. The most common Fibonacci retracement levels are 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. In this case, the stock is currently trading above the 61.8% retracement level, which is a bullish sign.\n* Bollinger Bands: The Bollinger Bands are a volatility indicator that shows the range of a stock's price movement. The Bollinger Bands are calculated by taking the simple moving average of a stock's price over a specified period of time and adding and subtracting two standard deviations from the moving average. The Bollinger Bands are plotted on a chart with the stock's price. In this case, the stock price is trading above the upper Bollinger Band, which indicates that the stock is in a bullish trend.\n\nOverall, the technical analysis indicators suggest that the stock is in a strong uptrend and is likely to continue to rise in the near future.","movingAverages":10,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":10,"relativeStrengthIndex":7,"fibonacciRetracement":8,"bollingerBands":7,"overallTrend":"upward","riskLevel":1,"overallRisk":"low","decision":"BUY","epic":"CC.D.C.USS.IP"}],"findings":{"movingAverages":6,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":5,"relativeStrengthIndex":5,"fibonacciRetracement":5,"bollingerBands":6,"overallTrend":["neutral","downward","upward","downward","upward"],"riskLevel":2,"overallRisk":"medium","decision":["HOLD","SELL","BUY","SELL","BUY"],"epic":"CC.D.C.USS.IP"},"open_position":false,"epic":"CC.D.C.USS.IP","aiDecisions":[["SELL","SELL","HOLD","HOLD","BUY"],["SELL","HOLD","HOLD","SELL"],["STRONG SELL","SELL","HOLD","STRONG BUY","HOLD"],"HOLD",["HOLD","SELL","BUY","SELL","BUY"]]}

The Moving Averages indicate a downward trend, with the short-term moving average below the long-term moving average. The MACD indicator is also in a downtrend, with the MACD line below the signal line. The Fibonacci Retracement levels indicate that the stock is currently trading near the 61.8% retracement level, which is a potential support level. The Bollinger Bands are also indicating a potential reversal, as the stock is trading near the lower Bollinger Band. The RSI indicator is in oversold territory, which suggests that the stock is due for a bounce.\n\nOverall, the technical analysis indicates a downward trend, but there are some signs that the stock may be due for a reversal.

The greater the difference, the stronger the signal. A positive reading is a buy signal, while a negative reading is a sell signal. For this stock, the Moving Averages score is 7 out of 10, indicating a buy signal.\n\nThe second analysis method, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), follows the difference between two moving averages: the short term moving average, and the long term moving average. When these averages cross over, it is considered a buy or sell signal. For this stock, the MACD score is 6 out of 10, indicating a buy signal.\n\nThe third analysis method, Relative Strength Index (RSI), measures the speed and magnitude of price changes of an asset. When the RSI is above 70, the stock is overbought and a sell signal is triggered. When the RSI is under 30, the stock is oversold and a buy signal is triggered. A reading of 50 indicates neither overbought or oversold. For this stock, the RSI is 62 out of 100, indicating the asset is overbought and could be a sell signal\n\nThe fourth analysis method, Fibonacci Retracement, draws horizontal price lines that correspond to key Fibonacci ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 78.6%. When the price of an asset retraces to a Fibonacci level, it is commonly thought that the price may reverse direction. For this stock, the Fibonacci Retracement score is 8 out of 10, indicating a buy signal. \n\nThe fifth analysis method, Bollinger Bands, is an indicator that calculates a price range based on volatility. When the price of a stock is outside of the upper limit, it could indicate that the asset is overbought. When the price of the stock is outside of the lower limit, it could indicate that the asset is oversold. For this stock, the Bollinger Bands score is 8 out of 10, indicating a buy signal.\n\nOverall, the Moving Averages, MACD, Fibonacci Retracement and Bollinger Bands analysis methods indicate buy signals. Whilst the RSI analysis method indicates a potential sell signal. However, the RSI is the only analysis method displaying a sell signal. Therefore, the overall trend for this stock is upward.\n\nThe risk level for this stock is 3 out of 5, indicating a medium risk level.

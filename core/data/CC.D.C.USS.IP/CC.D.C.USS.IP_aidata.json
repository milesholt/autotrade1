However, it is important to note that market conditions can change rapidly, and traders should always consider the latest market news and technical analysis before making any investment decisions.","movingAverages":3,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":2,"relativeStrengthIndex":2,"fibonacciRetracement":5,"bollingerBands":2,"overallTrend":"downward","riskLevel":3,"overallRisk":"medium","decision":"SELL","epic":"CC.D.C.USS.IP"},{"summary":"The stock's price has been on a downward trend since the end of July.

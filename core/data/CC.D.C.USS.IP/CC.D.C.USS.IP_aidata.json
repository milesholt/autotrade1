The moving averages are all below the current price, which indicates that the stock is likely to continue to fall. The MACD is also below the zero line, which is another sign of a bearish trend. The relative strength index is in the oversold territory, which means that the stock is due for a correction. The fibonacci retracement levels show that the stock is currently at the 61.8% retracement level, which is a key support level. If the stock breaks below this level, it could fall further.

This suggests that the stock price is not in a strong uptrend, but it is also not in a strong downtrend.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is indicating a neutral trend. The RSI is currently around 50, which is the midpoint of the indicator's range. This suggests that the stock is not in a strong uptrend, but it is also not in a strong downtrend.\n\nThe Fibonacci Retracement indicator suggests that the stock price is currently in a retracement from a recent high. The price has pulled back from a high of 2431.94 to a low of 2369.79. The significant Fibonacci Retracement levels are 23.6%, 38.2%, 50.0%, 61.8%, and 78.6%.

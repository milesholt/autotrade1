The data includes the open, close, high, and low prices for each day, as well as the last traded volume.\n\n**Moving Averages**\nThe moving averages (MA) are a technical analysis tool that helps to smooth out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. The most common moving averages are the simple moving average (SMA) and the exponential moving average (EMA). The MA score is a measure of how well the stock price is following the moving average. A score of 10 indicates that the stock price is closely following the moving average, while a score of 0 indicates that the stock price is not following the moving average.\n\n**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**\nThe MACD is a technical analysis indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day EMA from the 12-day EMA. The MACD score is a measure of how strong the MACD signal is. A score of 10 indicates that the MACD signal is strong, while a score of 0 indicates that the MACD signal is weak.\n\n**Relative Strength Index (RSI)**\nThe RSI is a technical analysis indicator that measures the strength of a stock's price movement. The RSI is calculated by comparing the average gain of the stock over a certain period of time to the average loss of the stock over the same period of time. The RSI score is a measure of how overbought or oversold a stock is. A score of 10 indicates that the stock is overbought, while a score of 0 indicates that the stock is oversold.\n\n**Fibonacci Retracement**\nThe Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool that identifies potential support and resistance levels. The Fibonacci retracement is based on the Fibonacci sequence, which is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The Fibonacci retracement score is a measure of how well the stock price is following the Fibonacci retracement levels. A score of 10 indicates that the stock price is closely following the Fibonacci retracement levels, while a score of 0 indicates that the stock price is not following the Fibonacci retracement levels.\n\n**Bollinger Bands**\nBollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool that helps to identify potential overbought and oversold conditions. Bollinger Bands are created by calculating the moving average of a stock's price and then adding and subtracting two standard deviations from the moving average. The Bollinger Bands score is a measure of how wide the Bollinger Bands are. A score of 10 indicates that the Bollinger Bands are wide, while a score of 0 indicates that the Bollinger Bands are narrow.\n\n**Overall Trend**\nThe overall trend of the stock price is **upward**. This is because the stock price has been making higher highs and higher lows over the past few days.\n\n**Risk Level**\nThe risk level of the stock is considered **moderate**. This is because the stock price has been volatile over the past few days. Volatility is a measure of how much the price of a stock moves up and down. A high level of volatility indicates that the stock price is more likely to experience large swings in price.\n\n**Overall Risk**\nThe overall risk of the stock is considered **medium**. This is because the stock has a moderate risk level and the overall trend is upward.\n\n**Decision**\nBased on the technical analysis, it is recommended to **HOLD** the stock.\n\n**Disclaimer**\nThis report is for informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice.","movingAverages":0,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":0,"relativeStrengthIndex":0,"fibonacciRetracement":0,"bollingerBands":0,"overallTrend":"upward","riskLevel":3,"overallRisk":"medium","decision":"HOLD","epic":"CS.D.USCGC.TODAY.IP"},{"summary":"The stock seems to be showing signs of a decline with a downward trend with high risk and overall moderate risk.

The 10-day moving average is below the 50-day moving average, indicating that the stock price is likely to continue to trade sideways in the short term.\n\nMACD: The MACD line is currently below the signal line, indicating that the stock price is likely to continue to decline in the short term.\n\nFibonacci Retracement: The stock price has recently retraced to the 61.8% Fibonacci level, which is a common support level.

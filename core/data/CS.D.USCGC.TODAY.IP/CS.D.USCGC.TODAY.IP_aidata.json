It is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA and displaying that value on a histogram, with the MACD line plotted on top of the histogram. The MACD line is also known as the MACD indicator. \n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a technical indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or over-sold conditions in an asset. It is calculated using a formula that incorporates the average gain and loss of a security over a specified period of time. \n\nThe Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool that is used to identify potential areas of support and resistance on a price chart. It is calculated by dividing the difference between two significant price points by a set of Fibonacci ratios, which are 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%. \n\nThe Bollinger Bands is a technical analysis tool that is used to identify potential areas of overbought and over-sold conditions on a price chart. It is calculated by taking the moving average of a security's price and then adding and subtracting two standard deviations to create upper and lower bands. \n\nOverall, the technical analysis methods used in this report suggest that the stock is currently in a downtrend. The MACD indicator is below zero, which indicates that the security is in a downtrend. The RSI is also below 50, which indicates that the security is oversold. The Fibonacci retracement levels suggest that the stock could potentially retrace to the 50% level, which is at $2,468.50. The Bollinger Bands are also indicating that the stock is oversold, as the price is below the lower Bollinger Band. \n\n**Overall Trend**\n\nThe overall trend for the stock is **downward**.\n\n**Risk Level**\n\nThe risk level for the stock is **4** out of 5.\n\n**Overall Risk**\n\nThe overall risk for the stock is **high**.\n\n**Decision**\n\nBased on the technical analysis, I would **SELL** the stock.","movingAverages":0,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":0,"relativeStrengthIndex":0,"fibonacciRetracement":0,"bollingerBands":0,"overallTrend":"downward","riskLevel":4,"overallRisk":"high","decision":"SELL","epic":"CS.D.USCGC.TODAY.IP"},{"summary":"The overall trend of the stock is slightly downward.

The analysis of the moving averages suggests a neutral trend. \n* **MACD**: This method looks at the relationship between two moving averages and can help identify changes in momentum. The MACD analysis suggests a slight bullish momentum. \n* **Fibonacci Retracement**: This method uses horizontal lines to identify potential support and resistance levels. The Fibonacci Retracement analysis suggests that the stock is approaching a support level of 2423. \n* **Bollinger Bands**: This method uses a moving average and two standard deviations to create a range of values that the stock is expected to stay within. The Bollinger Bands analysis suggests that the stock is trading near the lower end of the range, indicating a potential for a bounce. \n* **RSI**: This method measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or overbought conditions.

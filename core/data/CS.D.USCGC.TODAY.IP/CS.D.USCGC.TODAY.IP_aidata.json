Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an indicator of the momentum of a stock's price movement.

The RSI for the stock on the most recent trading day was 50.22, which indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Moving Averages (MA) is a technical analysis tool that helps to smooth out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. The most common moving averages are the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages. The 50-day MA is the average of the closing prices of the last 50 trading days. The 100-day MA is the average of the closing prices of the last 100 trading days. The 200-day MA is the average of the closing prices of the last 200 trading days. The stock's 50-day MA is 2437.92, the 100-day MA is 2435.09, and the 200-day MA is 2430.58. The stock's price is currently above all three of its moving averages, which indicates that the stock is in an uptrend. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a technical analysis indicator that is used to identify trend changes. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. The MACD is plotted as a line, with the signal line plotted on top of it. The signal line is a 9-day EMA of the MACD. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it indicates that a bullish trend is developing. When the MACD crosses below the signal line, it indicates that a bearish trend is developing. The stock's MACD is currently -0.18, which indicates that the stock is in a bearish trend.  Fibonacci Retracement is a technical analysis tool that is used to identify potential areas of support and resistance. Fibonacci retracement levels are calculated by taking the difference between the high and low prices of a stock and then dividing that difference by the Fibonacci ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. The stock's most recent high price was 2490.97, and the most recent low price was 2406.58. The Fibonacci retracement levels for the stock are as follows: 2452.87 (23.6%), 2440.42 (38.2%), 2427.96 (50%), 2415.51 (61.8%), and 2403.06 (78.6%). The stock's price is currently below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, which indicates that the stock is in a downtrend. Bollinger Bands is a technical analysis tool that is used to identify potential areas of overbought and oversold conditions. Bollinger Bands are calculated by taking the simple moving average (SMA) of a stock's price over a specified period of time (usually 20 days) and then adding and subtracting two standard deviations from the SMA. The upper Bollinger Band is the SMA plus two standard deviations, and the lower Bollinger Band is the SMA minus two standard deviations. When a stock's price is above the upper Bollinger Band, it is considered to be overbought. When a stock's price is below the lower Bollinger Band, it is considered to be oversold. The stock's Bollinger Bands are currently 2448.76 (upper), 2435.06 (middle), and 2421.36 (lower). The stock's price is currently between the upper and lower Bollinger Bands, which indicates that the stock is not overbought or oversold. Overall, the technical analysis indicates that the stock is in a neutral trend. The stock's price is above its moving averages, but below its Fibonacci retracement levels. The stock's MACD is bearish, but its RSI is neutral. The stock's Bollinger Bands indicate that the stock is not overbought or oversold. Given these factors, it is recommended to hold the stock.","movingAverages":5,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":2,"relativeStrengthIndex":8,"fibonacciRetracement":3,"bollingerBands":5,"overallTrend":"neutral","riskLevel":0,"overallRisk":"low","decision":"HOLD","epic":"CS.D.USCGC.TODAY.IP"},{"summary":"The stock market can be highly volatile, a situation which is reflected in both daily price action and the number of price swings we see.

As such, it should only be used as one of many tools when making investment decisions, and never in isolation. It is also important to remember that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results and that all investing involves risk.\n\nOverall, the technical indicators are giving mixed signals. The stock is in an uptrend, but it is overbought. This suggests that the stock may be due for a correction. However, the other indicators are all bullish and suggest that it may see higher prices in the future. In the meantime, it may be prudent to take a more bullish approach and buy the stock, but with suitable stop-loss orders in place to manage risk.","movingAverages":7,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":7,"relativeStrengthIndex":4,"fibonacciRetracement":7,"bollingerBands":7,"overallTrend":"upward","riskLevel":3,"overallRisk":"medium","decision":"STRONG BUY","epic":"CS.D.USCGC.TODAY.IP"},{"summary":"The recent price performance of this stock is stable with a slight upward trend, however the 24 hour performance shows a clear downward trend.

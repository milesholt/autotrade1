The price of the stock has been dropping consistently after reaching a high of $2458.29 on 2024/08/01 02:00:00. This is a cause of some concern as the price could continue to drop, leading to a potential loss in capital. The risk level is currently at 4 out of 5, which is considered to be high. The overall risk is medium, as the stock has been performing poorly recently and the risk of further losses is high.\n\nThe moving averages and relative strength index indicate a downward trend in the stock's price. The moving averages show that the stock's price has been consistently below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, which is a bearish sign. The RSI is also below 50, which indicates that the stock is oversold and could be due for a correction.\n\nThe Fibonacci retracement shows that the stock's price has been retracing from the high of $2458.29 to the low of $2364.23.

If the stock's price continues to fall below the lower Bollinger Band, it could indicate that the stock is in a downtrend and could continue to fall.","movingAverages":3,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":6,"relativeStrengthIndex":2,"fibonacciRetracement":7,"bollingerBands":5,"overallTrend":"downward","riskLevel":4,"overallRisk":"medium","decision":"SELL","epic":"CS.D.USCGC.TODAY.IP"},{"summary":"The overall trend of the stock is upwards.

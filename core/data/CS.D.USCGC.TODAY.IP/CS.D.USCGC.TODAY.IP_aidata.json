The stock has been unable to break above the 2482 resistance level, and has also been unable to fall below the 2465 support level. This suggests that the stock is currently in a consolidation phase, and is likely to continue trading within this range in the near term.\n\nIn the short term, the stock is likely to continue trading within the 2465 to 2482 range.

The MACD line is below the signal line, and the histogram is negative. This suggests that the stock price is likely to continue to decline in the short term. *MACD score: 2 out of 103. Fibonacci Retracement: The Fibonacci retracement analysis indicates that the stock price is currently at the 61.8% retracement level. This suggests that the stock price is likely to continue to decline to the 78.6% retracement level before finding support. *Fibonacci Retracement score: 6 out of 104.

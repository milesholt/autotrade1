However, there are signs of a potential reversal, so it would be wise to proceed with caution. \n\nThe moving averages are indicating a potential sell signal, as the shorter-term moving average has crossed below the longer-term moving average.

This is another bearish sign and suggests that the stock price may be headed lower. \n\nThe RSI indicator is currently in overbought territory, which means that the stock may be due for a correction.

They are used to smooth out price movements and identify trends. A shorter period, such as 10 days or 20 days, will be more responsive to price changes, but also more prone to whipsaws. A longer period, such as 50 days or 200 days, will be less responsive to price changes, but also less likely to whipsaw. The 50 day moving average is a popular moving average for identifying intermediate-term trends, and is a value of 4 out of 10 for this stock.\n\nMACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)\nThe MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a stock's price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A 9-day EMA of the MACD, called the signal line, is then plotted on top of the MACD line. Divergence occurs when the MACD and the price of the stock are moving in opposite directions. When the MACD is above the signal line and rising, it indicates that the stock is in a bullish trend. When the MACD is below the signal line and falling, it indicates that the stock is in a bearish trend. The MACD is a value of 6 out of 10 for this stock.\n\nBollinger Bands\nBollinger Bands are a volatility indicator that shows the range of prices a stock is likely to trade within. Bollinger Bands are calculated by taking the 20-day moving average of a stock's price and adding and subtracting two standard deviations. The resulting upper and lower bands are a dynamic measure of volatility. When prices are trading near the upper band, it indicates that prices are overbought and may be due for a correction. When prices are trading near the lower band, it indicates that prices are oversold and may be due for a rally. The Bollinger Bands are a value of 5 out of 10 for this stock.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions. RSI is calculated on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 indicates that the stock is overbought and a reading below 30 indicates that it is oversold. Divergence occurs when the RSI is moving in the opposite direction of the price. When the RSI is above 70 and falling, it indicates that the stock is overbought and may be due for a correction. When the RSI is below 30 and rising, it indicates that the stock is oversold and may be due for a rally. RSI is a value of 4 out of 10 for this stock.\n\nFibonacci Retracement\nFibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines that are drawn at key percentage levels, such as 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. These levels are used to identify potential areas of support and resistance. When a stock price retraces to a Fibonacci level, it can provide an opportunity to buy or sell. The Fibonacci retracement level of 61.8% is a value of 6 out of 10 for this stock. \n\nOverall Trend\nThe overall trend is slightly bullish. The stock price has been moving within a range for the past few months. On 2024/07/31, the price broke out of the range on the upside and has continued to move higher since then. Higher highs and higher lows are considered a bullish trend.\n\nRisk Level\nThe overall risk level is 3 out of 5. The stock price is volatile and has the potential to move quickly in either direction. However, the overall trend is bullish as the stock is consolidating around its 50 day moving average and establishing a base for further upward movement.\n\nOverall Risk\nThe overall risk is considered medium. The stock price is volatile but has a clear trend. The potential for reward is high as the stock has the potential to continue to move higher in the medium term.\n\nDecision\nOverall the stock is in a BUY or STRONG BUY position. The stock price has been moving within a range for the past few months and finally broke out on the upside. Technical indicators are showing that the stock is in a bullish trend and has the potential to continue to move higher in the medium term.","movingAverages":4,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":6,"relativeStrengthIndex":4,"fibonacciRetracement":6,"bollingerBands":5,"overallTrend":"upward","riskLevel":3,"overallRisk":"medium","decision":"STRONG BUY","epic":"CS.D.USCGC.TODAY.IP"}],"findings":{"movingAverages":5,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":5,"relativeStrengthIndex":6,"fibonacciRetracement":6,"bollingerBands":5,"overallTrend":"upward","riskLevel":3,"overallRisk":"medium","decision":"BUY","epic":"CS.D.USCGC.TODAY.IP"},"open_position":false,"epic":"CS.D.USCGC.TODAY.IP","aiDecisions":["SELL","HOLD","HOLD","SELL","BUY"]}

{"results":[{"summary":"A moving average is a technical analysis tool that helps smooth out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. The moving averages used on this analysis are based on a 10-day period. The moving averages convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. The MACD line is then plotted along with a 9-day EMA of the MACD, called the signal line. The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions. The RSI is calculated on a scale of 0 to 100, with 30 and 70 as overbought and oversold levels, respectively. The Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool that identifies potential support and resistance levels based on the Fibonacci sequence. It is calculated by taking two significant price points, typically a high and a low, and then dividing the vertical distance between them into Fibonacci ratios. The Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool that uses a moving average and standard deviation to identify overbought and oversold conditions. The Bollinger Bands consist of three lines: an upper band, a lower band, and a middle band (the moving average). The upper and lower bands are plotted two standard deviations away from the moving average. Overall, while some technical analysis indicators may suggest an upward trend, others indicate a downward trend, and others still suggest the stock is fairly valued. As such the overallTrend is neutral. The riskLevel is 3 , and the overallRisk is medium. Although the share price has a slightly higher chance of increasing according to this analysis, due to caution advised when making investment decisions based solely on technical indicators  we recommend a HOLD decision.","movingAverages":0,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":0,"relativeStrengthIndex":0,"fibonacciRetracement":0,"bollingerBands":0,"overallTrend":"neutral","riskLevel":3,"overallRisk":"medium","decision":"HOLD","epic":"CS.D.USCGC.TODAY.IP"},{"summary":"The overall trend for the stock is upward.

The MACD shows a positive trend with the Signal Line crossing above the MACD Line. The RSI also shows a positive trend, with the value above 50 and generally trending upwards. The Fibonacci Retracement indicates a potential for a retracement to the 23.6% Fibonacci level at 2401.64. The Bollinger Bands are wide, indicating high volatility. Overall, the technical analysis suggests a positive trend with some volatility. The risk level is considered medium with a moderate overall risk.

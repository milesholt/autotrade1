{"results":[{"summary":"The trend in the last two weeks is generally downward, with many spikes up and down. The most recent two days have shown a substantial downturn of more than 150 pips, and due to the high last traded volume suggests that this is due to significant selling pressure rather than just price discovery. Although we see some potentially oversold conditions, there are no signs of a reversal in the long term trend, and given the less than favourable position of RSI, Bollinger Bands and the Moving Averages, a downward trend is likely to continue. Fibonacci levels offer some potential targets, with the 38.2% retracement level being the most likely point at which the market may bounce back up. However, the 50% midpoint and 61.8% retracement level also offer potential reversal points should the market recover. Looking at the MACD histogram, we have recently dropped below the zero line, and there is a lack of upward momentum, indicating that the downtrend is likely to continue. Overall, the market sentiment is very bearish and the risk level is high, with support at 746 and resistance at 748 in the short term. Considering the above, while the asset might be oversold in the short term, the overall trend is downward and therefore, the decision is **SELL**","movingAverages":2,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":3,"relativeStrengthIndex":1,"fibonacciRetracement":7,"bollingerBands":6,"overallTrend":"upward","riskLevel":4,"overallRisk":"high","decision":"STRONG SELL","epic":"CS.D.MXNJPY.TODAY.IP"},{"summary":"The stock has been trending downwards in the past few days, with a slight uptick in the past few hours.

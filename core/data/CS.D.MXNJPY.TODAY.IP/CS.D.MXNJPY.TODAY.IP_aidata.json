Before that it had been in a constant uptrend since the start of the month. The price action is currently forming a potential double bottom around 869.4. The Moving Averages are giving a strong indication that the stock price is going down, as the 50-day MA is below the 200-day MA. The MACD is also indicating a sell signal, as the MACD line is below the signal line and the histogram is negative. The RSI is currently in oversold territory, which could indicate that the stock is due for a bounce, but it is difficult to tell with price action continuing to make lower lows. The Fibonacci Retracement tool shows that the price has reached the 61.8% retracement level, which is a potential support level. The Bollinger Bands are currently squeezing, which could indicate that a breakout is about to happen. Overall, the technical analysis indicates that the price of MXNJPY is in a downtrend and is likely to continue to fall in the short term. However, the oversold RSI and the potential double bottom formation could indicate that a bounce is possible in the near future.\n\nThe overall trend is downward.\n\nThe overall risk level is 3 out of 5.\n\nThe overall risk is medium.","movingAverages":0,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":0,"relativeStrengthIndex":0,"fibonacciRetracement":0,"bollingerBands":0,"overallTrend":"downward","riskLevel":3,"overallRisk":"medium","decision":"HOLD","epic":"CS.D.MXNJPY.TODAY.IP"},{"summary":"During the observed period, the stock price shows a moderate level of fluctuation.

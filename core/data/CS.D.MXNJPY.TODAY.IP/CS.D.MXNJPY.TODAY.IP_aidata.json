This could indicate that a pullback or downtrend is likely in the near term. The MACD indicator is also indicating a potential bearish trend, as the MACD line has crossed below the signal line. This could further support the idea that a pullback or downtrend is likely in the near term.

The Bollinger Bands indicator is showing that the price is currently trading below the lower Bollinger Band. This could indicate that a pullback or downtrend is likely in the near term.

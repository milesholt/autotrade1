Based on the Moving Averages method which looks at the simple moving average (SMA) and the exponential moving average (EMA), the stock has a score of 0 out of 10. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator measures the relationship between two moving averages of prices. The MACD line is the difference between the 12-day EMA and the 26-day EMA, and the signal line is the 9-day EMA of the MACD line. When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it is considered a bullish signal, and when it crosses below the signal line, it is considered a bearish signal. The MACD gives the stock a score of 0 out of 10. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or overbought conditions in the price of a stock. An RSI reading above 70 indicates that a stock is overbought and may be due for a correction or reversal. An RSI reading below 30 indicates that a stock is oversold or undervalued and may be due for a correction or reversal. The RSI gives the stock a score of 1. The Fibonacci Retracement is a method of technical analysis for identifying potential support and resistance levels in the price of a stock. The Fibonacci Retracement tool is based on the idea that prices tend to retrace a certain percentage of the previous move, after reaching a high or low. Common Fibonacci retracement levels are 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. The Fibonacci Retracement gives the stock a score of 0 out of 10. The Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool that measures the volatility of a stock's price. The Bollinger Bands consist of three lines: an upper band, a middle band (which is the simple moving average of the stock's price), and a lower band. The Bollinger Bands give the stock a score of 0 out of 10. Given these indicators, the overall trend is downward, the risk level is 5 out of 5, and the overall risk is high. The recommendation is to SELL.","movingAverages":0,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":0,"relativeStrengthIndex":1,"fibonacciRetracement":0,"bollingerBands":0,"overallTrend":"downward","riskLevel":5,"overallRisk":"high","decision":"SELL","epic":"CS.D.MXNJPY.TODAY.IP"},{"summary":"The moving averages for the given financial data show a downward trend, indicating that the stock price is likely to continue to decrease.

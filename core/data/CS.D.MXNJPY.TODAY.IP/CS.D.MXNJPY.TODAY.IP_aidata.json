The 9-day SMA is currently 896.86, which is below the current price of 890.7. This indicates that the stock is currently trading below its 9-day moving average, which could be a bearish sign.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of the stock's price. The MACD is currently -0.15, which is below the zero line. This indicates that the stock is currently in a downtrend, which is confirmed by the histogram, which is also below the zero line.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions. The RSI is currently 42.46, which is in the neutral range. This indicates that the stock is not currently overbought or oversold.\n\nThe Fibonacci Retracement is a technical analysis tool that identifies potential areas of support and resistance. The Fibonacci levels are calculated by taking the difference between the high and low prices of a given period and then dividing that number by certain Fibonacci ratios. The most common Fibonacci ratios are 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%. The stock is currently trading near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, which is a potential area of support.\n\nThe Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool that helps identify overbought or oversold conditions. The Bollinger Bands are calculated by taking the moving average of the stock's price and then adding and subtracting two standard deviations. The stock is currently trading below the lower Bollinger Band, which indicates that it is oversold.\n\nOverall, the technical analysis indicators are giving mixed signals. The SMA and MACD indicate that the stock is in a downtrend, while the RSI and Fibonacci Retracement indicate that it is oversold. The Bollinger Bands indicate that the stock is oversold, which could be a sign that it is due for a bounce. However, it is important to note that technical analysis is not a perfect science and should only be used as one factor in making investment decisions.\n\nThe overall risk level is 3 out of 5. The stock has been in a downtrend for the past several days and is currently trading below its 9-day moving average. The MACD and Bollinger Bands are also indicating that the stock is oversold, which could be a sign that it is due for a bounce.

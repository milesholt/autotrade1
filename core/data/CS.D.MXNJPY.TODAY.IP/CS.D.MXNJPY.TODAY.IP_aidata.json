The short-term moving average is calculated by taking the average of the closing prices over the last 50 days, and the long-term moving average is calculated by taking the average of the closing prices over the last 200 days. The moving averages are used to identify the trend of the stock. When the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, the stock is in an uptrend. When the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, the stock is in a downtrend.\n\nMACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): The MACD is a momentum indicator that measures the difference between the 12-day exponential moving average (EMA) and the 26-day EMA. The MACD is used to identify the trend of the stock and to identify trading opportunities. When the MACD is above the signal line, the stock is in an uptrend. When the MACD is below the signal line, the stock is in a downtrend.\n\nRelative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes. The RSI is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. When the RSI is above 70, the stock is considered to be overbought. When the RSI is below 30, the stock is considered to be oversold.\n\nFibonacci Retracement: The Fibonacci retracement levels are a series of horizontal lines that are used to identify potential areas of support and resistance. The Fibonacci retracement levels are calculated by taking the difference between the highest and lowest prices of a stock over a specific period of time and dividing the difference by 0.618, 0.382, and 0.236.\n\nBollinger Bands: The Bollinger Bands are a volatility indicator that measures the standard deviation of the closing prices over a specific period of time. The Bollinger Bands are used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. When the stock is trading above the upper Bollinger Band, the stock is considered to be overbought. When the stock is trading below the lower Bollinger Band, the stock is considered to be oversold.\n\nOverall Trend: The overall trend of the stock is determined by the direction of the moving averages. When the moving averages are sloping up, the stock is in an uptrend. When the moving averages are sloping down, the stock is in a downtrend.\n\nRisk Level: The risk level is determined by the volatility of the stock. The higher the volatility, the higher the risk. The volatility of the stock is measured by the Bollinger Bands. When the Bollinger Bands are wide, the stock is considered to be more volatile. When the Bollinger Bands are narrow, the stock is considered to be less volatile.\n\nOverall Risk: The overall risk is determined by the risk level and the overall trend. When the risk level is high and the overall trend is down, the overall risk is high. When the risk level is low and the overall trend is up, the overall risk is low.\n\nDecision: The decision of whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock is based on the overall risk and the overall trend. When the overall risk is low and the overall trend is up, the decision is to buy. When the overall risk is high and the overall trend is down, the decision is to sell. When the overall risk is low and the overall trend is neutral, the decision is to hold.","movingAverages":5,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":6,"relativeStrengthIndex":5,"fibonacciRetracement":5,"bollingerBands":5,"overallTrend":"downward","riskLevel":1,"overallRisk":"low","decision":"HOLD","epic":"CS.D.MXNJPY.TODAY.IP"}],"findings":{"movingAverages":4,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":4,"relativeStrengthIndex":5,"fibonacciRetracement":5,"bollingerBands":5,"overallTrend":"downward","riskLevel":2,"overallRisk":"low","decision":"HOLD","epic":"CS.D.MXNJPY.TODAY.IP"},"open_position":false,"epic":"CS.D.MXNJPY.TODAY.IP","aiDecisions":["SELL","HOLD","BUY","HOLD","HOLD"]}

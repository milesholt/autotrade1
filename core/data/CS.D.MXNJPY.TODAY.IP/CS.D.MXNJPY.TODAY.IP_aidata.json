The positive MA score is likely because the short-term moving average 20, 50 and 100 are above the long-term moving average 200. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) analysis also gives a weak indication of the stock price going up with a score of 3 out of 10. However, the MACD is below its signal line which is a negative sign. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) analysis provides a more neutral view with a score of 5 out of 10, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The Fibonacci Retracement analysis gives a weak indication of the stock price going down with a score of 2 out of 10. The Bollinger Bands analysis shows a weak indication of the stock price going up with a score of 4 out of 10.

A higher score indicates that the stock price is more likely to go up in the future. In this case, the score is 3 out of 10, indicating a slightly bearish trend.\n* **Moving Averages Convergence Divergence (MACD):** This method assesses the momentum of the stock price. A higher score indicates that the stock price is more likely to go up in the future. The MACD score is 4 out of 10, indicating a slightly bullish trend.\n* **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** This method gauges the strength of the price movement. A higher score indicates that the stock price is more likely to go up in the future. In this case, the RSI score is 5 out of 10, suggesting that the stock is slightly overbought.\n* **Fibonacci Retracement:** This method measures the support and resistance levels of a stock. A higher score indicates that the stock price is more likely to retrace to a lower level. The Fibonacci Retracement score is 6 out of 10, indicating a possible retracement in the near future.\n* **Bollinger Bands:** This method identifies the upper and lower limits of the price movement. A higher score indicates that the stock price is more likely to stay within those limits. The Bollinger Bands score is 7 out of 10, suggesting that the stock is currently within its expected range.\n\nBased on these five methods, the overall trend is determined as \"neutral\".

This bullish momentum continued, with buyers pushing the price to an intraday high of 811.9 at midday, following the Japanese Yen's weakening against several major currencies. However, this bullish dominance was short-lived, as bears stepped in and caused a sharp reversal, driving the currency pair down by over 11% to a daily low of 790.6. This sudden shift was largely attributed to a combination of profit-taking by previous buyers and a renewed fear of a global recession, triggering a sell-off in riskier assets. Despite the afternoon rebound that followed, which briefly lifted the price above 800, the downtrend reasserted itself. The trading session ended at 788.5, leaving the currency pair with a loss of around 2.5% for the day. The price action observed throughout the session suggests a high level of volatility, uncertainty, and indecision among market participants. Technical indicators such as moving averages, MACD, and Bollinger Bands show that the recent bearish momentum may continue in the short term. However, it is important to note that based on the provided data, the overall long-term trend remains neutral, indicating that a significant reversal or continuation of the downtrend cannot be conclusively determined. Given the high level of volatility and mixed signals from technical indicators, traders are advised to exercise caution and closely monitor market developments before making any trading decisions.","movingAverages":4,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":4,"relativeStrengthIndex":5,"fibonacciRetracement":6,"bollingerBands":4,"overallTrend":"neutral","riskLevel":3,"overallRisk":"medium","decision":"HOLD","epic":"CS.D.MXNJPY.TODAY.IP"},{"summary":"The recent price action for this stock is highly volatile, with many large swings in both directions.

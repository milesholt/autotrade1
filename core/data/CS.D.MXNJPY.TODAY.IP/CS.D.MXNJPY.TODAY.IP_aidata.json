{"results":[{"summary":"The Moving Averages analysis shows that the stock's medium-term trend is sideways, and very slightly downwards. Looking at the MACD indicator, the MACD line is below the signal line and decreasing, which indicates a medium-term bearish trend. The RSI shows that the stock is oversold in the short to medium term. The Fibonacci Retracement analysis suggest the stock has tested the 50% retracement level since its last swing high which means it has some room to return to the upside. Since the price is very close to the 50% retracement level and with the RSI being so low, it is likely that the stock could bounce or start moving upwards from here. So technically the outlook seems to be bullish. However, the Bollinger Bands indicator shows that the stock's price is currently trading below the lower Bollinger Band, which indicates that the stock is trading at a low price relative to its recent trading history. In the past, when the stock's price has been trading below the lower Bollinger Band, it has often been followed by a period of increased volatility and a decrease in price. Overall the analysis provides a mix of bullish and bearish signals, the price having broken below the 50% retracement and below the lower Bollinger Band suggests that there is a high probability we could see the price decrease.

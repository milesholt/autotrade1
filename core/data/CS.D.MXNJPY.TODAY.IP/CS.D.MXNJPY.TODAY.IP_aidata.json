The MACD indicator also shows a bearish trend, with the MACD line below the signal line and the histogram bars decreasing in size.\n\nThe Bollinger Bands indicator shows that the price is currently trading below the lower Bollinger Band, indicating that the stock is oversold and could be due for a correction.\n\nThe Fibonacci Retracement indicator suggests that the stock could potentially retrace to the 61.8% or 78.6% Fibonacci levels, which would be around 816.5 and 808.5, respectively.\n\nThe RSI indicator is currently in oversold territory, which suggests that the stock could be due for a short-term bounce.

Our analysis indicates that the stock is currently in a downward trend, as the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average. \n\nMACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): The MACD is used to measure the momentum of the market. The MACD line is below the signal line, suggesting a bearish trend, aligning with the Moving Averages analysis.\n\nFibonacci Retracement: This indicator is used to identify potential support and resistance levels. The stock has recently tested the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, indicating that it may have found some support at this level. However, it's crucial to note that Fibonacci retracement levels are not exact predictors of future price movements and should be considered in conjunction with other technical indicators. \n\nBollinger Bands: This indicator measures the volatility of the market.

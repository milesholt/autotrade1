Moving Average: The moving average is a technical analysis tool that helps smooth out price data by creating a constantly updated average of a security's prices over a specified period of time. It is used to identify the overall trend of a security's price and to filter out random price fluctuations. The moving average is calculated by summing up the closing prices of a security over a specified period of time and then dividing that sum by the number of periods. The most common moving averages are the 50-day moving average, the 100-day moving average, and the 200-day moving average.\nIn this case, the moving average will be calculated using the closing prices of the security over the past 10 days. The score for the moving average will be based on the slope of the moving average. A positive slope indicates that the security's price is trending upwards, while a negative slope indicates that the security's price is trending downwards. The higher the score, the stronger the trend.\n\n2. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): The MACD is a technical analysis indicator that is used to identify changes in the momentum of a security's price. It is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. The MACD is then plotted as a histogram, with the positive values above the zero line and the negative values below the zero line. The MACD can be used to identify bullish and bearish trends, as well as overbought and oversold conditions.\nThe score for the MACD will be based on the slope of the MACD line. A positive slope indicates that the MACD is trending upwards, while a negative slope indicates that the MACD is trending downwards. The higher the score, the stronger the trend.\n\n3. Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI is a technical analysis indicator that is used to measure the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock. It is calculated by taking the average gain of the security's price over a specified period of time and dividing it by the average loss of the security's price over the same period of time. The RSI is then plotted as a line graph, with the values ranging from 0 to 100.\nThe score for the RSI will be based on the value of the RSI. A RSI value above 70 indicates that the security is overbought, while a RSI value below 30 indicates that the security is oversold. The higher the score, the more overbought or oversold the security is.\n\n4. Fibonacci Retracement: The Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool that is used to identify potential areas of support and resistance in a security's price. It is based on the Fibonacci sequence, which is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The Fibonacci retracement levels are calculated by taking the difference between the high and low prices of a security over a specified period of time and then dividing that difference by the Fibonacci ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%.\nThe score for the Fibonacci retracement will be based on the number of Fibonacci retracement levels that the security's price has touched. The more Fibonacci retracement levels that the security's price has touched, the stronger the support or resistance level is.\n\n5. Bollinger Bands: Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool that is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in a security's price. They are calculated by taking the moving average of a security's price over a specified period of time and then adding and subtracting two standard deviations to the moving average. The Bollinger Bands are then plotted as a line graph, with the upper Bollinger Band representing the overbought level and the lower Bollinger Band representing the oversold level. The score for the Bollinger Bands will be based on the distance between the security's price and the Bollinger Bands. The greater the distance between the security's price and the Bollinger Bands, the more overbought or oversold the security is.\n\nBased on the above information, the summary report is as follows:\n\nThe security's price is currently in a downtrend, as indicated by the negative slope of the moving average and the MACD. The RSI is also below 30, indicating that the security is oversold. The Fibonacci retracement shows that the security's price has touched the 38.2% and 50% retracement levels, which indicates that there is support at these levels. The Bollinger Bands are also showing that the security's price is oversold, as it is below the lower Bollinger Band.\n\nOverall, the technical analysis indicates that the security's price is likely to continue to decline in the short term. However, there is support at the 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci retracement levels, which could provide some support to the security's price. If the security's price breaks below the lower Bollinger Band, it could indicate that the downtrend is continuing.\n\nThe risk level is 5 out of 5. The overall risk is high. The decision is SELL.","movingAverages":0,"movingAveragesConvergenceDivergence":8,"relativeStrengthIndex":4,"fibonacciRetracement":6,"bollingerBands":4,"overallTrend":"downward","riskLevel":5,"overallRisk":"high","decision":"SELL","epic":"CS.D.MXNJPY.TODAY.IP"},{"summary":"Closing prices in the past trading week moved in a narrow range between 828.5 and 810.9, indicating a period of consolidation without a clear directional bias. The overall sentiment over the past month has been predominantly bearish, with the stock facing resistance at the psychological level of 830 due to a combination of profit-taking and concerns about the company's earnings outlook. The technical indicators are also showing mixed signals, with some suggesting a potential for further downside if the support level of 810 is breached and others indicating some signs of stabilization. However, it is important to note that the stock has bounced back from the recent low of 810.9 and may have found some short-term support around the 812 level.

The RSI indicator is also showing a bearish signal, with a value below 50. The Fibonacci retracement indicator suggests that the stock may find support at the 61.8% retracement level, which is around 748.5. The Bollinger Bands indicator is showing that the stock is trading below the lower Bollinger Band, which is a sign of weakness. Overall, the technical indicators suggest that the stock is likely to continue falling in the short term, but this could be an opportunity to buy for a potential bounce or reversal.\n\nThe risk level is moderate, as the stock is showing signs of volatility.
